# flutter_course
Flutter application created along the [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/share/1013o4BUIfeVtbTH4=/) I was following

## Getting started
In order to get the application up and running you will have to clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AlecsisDuarte/flutter_course.git

```
And then edit the configuration file at `flutter_course/assets/config.json`
adding your **Geocoding API KEY** created at the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).

## Notes
* I haven't tested the iOS part of the application (Because I don't have a Mac :unamused: )
* This application was made just as a test/practice of the udemy course
